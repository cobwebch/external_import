Child records configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "children" property is used to create nested structures, generally
MM tables where additional information needs to be stored.

.. note::

   This corresponds to :ref:`inline-type ("IRRE") fields <t3tca:columns-inline>`
   with MM tables having a primary key field ("uid").

See the :ref:`Mapping data <user-mapping-data>` chapter for an overview of import
scenarios which may help understand this feature.


**Example:**

.. code-block:: php

      $GLOBALS['TCA']['tx_externalimporttest_product']['columns']['pictures']['external'] = [
         'base' => [
              'field' => 'Pictures', // remote db field
              'transformations' => [
                  10 => [
                      'userFunction' => [
                          'class' => \Cobweb\ExternalImport\Transformation\ImageTransformation::class,
                          'method' => 'saveImageFromUri',
                          'parameters' => [
                              'storage' => '1:importedpictures', // local folder for files
                          ]
                      ]
                  ]
              ],
              'children' => [
                  'table' => 'sys_file_reference',
                  'columns' => [
                      'uid_local' => [
                          'field' => 'pictures'
                      ],
                      'uid_foreign' => [
                          'field' => '__parent.id__'
                      ],
                      'title' => [
                          'field' => 'picture_title'
                      ],
                      'tablenames' => [
                          'value' => 'tx_externalimporttest_product'
                      ],
                      'fieldname' => [
                          'value' => 'pictures'
                      ],
                      'table_local' => [
                          'value' => 'sys_file'
                      ]
                  ],
                  'sorting' => [
                      'source' => 'picture_order',
                      'target' => 'sorting_foreign'
                  ],
                  'controlColumnsForUpdate' => 'uid_local, uid_foreign, tablenames, fieldname, table_local',
                  'controlColumnsForDelete' => 'uid_foreign, tablenames, fieldname, table_local'
              ]
             ...
         ]

.. _administration-children-properties-table:

table
~~~~~

Type
  string

Description
  Name of the nested table. This information is mandatory.

Scope
  Store data


.. _administration-children-properties-columns:

columns
~~~~~~~

Type
  array

Description
  List of columns (database fields) needed for the nested table. This is an
  associative array, using the column name as the key. Then each column must
  have one of two properties:

  value
    This is a simple value that will be used for each entry into the nested table.
    Use it for invariants like the "tablenames" field of a MM table.

  field
    This is the name of a field that is available in the imported data. The value
    is copied from the current record. Note that such fields can be any of the mapped
    columns, any of the :ref:`additionalFields <administration-additionalfields>` or
    any of the :ref:`substructureFields <administration-columns-properties-substructure-fields>`.

    The special value :code:`__parent.id__` refers to the primary key of the current
    record and will typically be used for "uid_local" or "uid_foreign" fields in MM
    tables, depending on how the relation is built.

Scope
  Store data


.. _administration-children-properties-control-columns-for-update:

controlColumnsForUpdate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type
  string

Description
  Comma-separated list of columns that need to be used for checking if a child record
  already exists. All these columns must exist in the list of :ref:`columns <administration-children-properties-columns>`
  defined above. Defining this property ensures that existing relations are updated
  instead of being created anew.

  This list should contain all columns that are significant for identifying a child
  record without ambiguity. In the example above, we have:

  .. code-block:: php

      'controlColumnsForUpdate' => 'uid_local, uid_foreign, tablenames, fieldname, table_local',

  These are all the columns that need to be queried in the "sys_file_reference" table to be sure
  that we are targeting the right record in the database. Any missing information might mean retrieving
  another record (for a different table or field, or whatever).

  .. note::

     If this property is not defined, all children records will be considered to be new.
     If :ref:`controlColumnsForDelete <administration-children-properties-control-columns-for-delete>`
     is defined and the "delete" operation is not :ref:`disabled <administration-children-properties-control-columns-for-disabled-operations>`,
     all existing child relations will be deleted upon each import.

Scope
  Store data


.. _administration-children-properties-control-columns-for-delete:

controlColumnsForDelete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type
  string

Description
  This is similar to :ref:`controlColumnsForUpdate <administration-children-properties-control-columns-for-update>`
  but for finding out which existing relations are no longer relevant and need to be
  deleted. It is not the same list of fields as you need to leave out the field
  which references the relation on the "other side". In the case of "sys_file_reference",
  you would leave out "uid_local", which is the reference to the "sys_file" table.

  .. note::

     If this property is not defined, existing children records will not be checked and thus
     never be deleted.

Scope
  Store data


.. _administration-children-properties-sorting:

sorting
~~~~~~~

Type
  array

Description
  External Import stores child records in the order in which they appear, which is generally
  the order in which they are in the external data source. It may be needed to sort the child
  records differently, according to some other data available in the in the external source.

  This property allows this. It is defined by two elements:

  source
    The name of the column containing the sorting value in the external data source.
    This column should ideally contain numerical values. If that is not the case, the values
    are cast to integer when they are used, so you need to make sure that the values contained
    in this column can be cast safely.

    If the sorting value is missing for some records, a value of :code:`0` will be used
    instead, putting those child records at the top of the list.

  target
    The name of the sorting field in the child record table.

  Both elements are mandatory. Configuration validation will fail otherwise.

  .. code-block:: php

      'sorting' => [
          'source' => 'picture_order',
          'target' => 'sorting_foreign'
      ],

Scope
  Store data


.. _administration-children-properties-disabled-operations:
.. _administration-children-properties-control-columns-for-disabled-operations:

disabledOperations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type
  string

Description
  Comma-separated list of operations which should not take place. This can be "insert"
  (no new child records), "update" (no update to existing child records) and/or
  "delete" (no removal of existing child records).

  .. note::

     This applies only when a parent record is being updated. When a parent record
     is being created, it does not make sense to forbid creation of its child records.

Scope
  Store data
